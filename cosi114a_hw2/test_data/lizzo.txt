Yeah I ca n’t do this Twitter shit no more .. too many trolls ... ✌ 🏾I’ll be back when I feel like it .
Spot - fuckin - on every time fuck !
THIS is why I do what I do !
Shine sista ! ! ! ! !

I never feel like I ’m helping enough ..
Polarity will always exist .
Good will always be versus Evil .
One opinion will always oppose the other .
Your opinion does not make you a bad person .
It ’s your actions that matter .
Do better is n’t an insult , it ’s a plea .
We need betterment more than anything .
“ I been gettin to the money , errbody mad ” becomes more and more relatable each day ...
Thot pics do n’t even hit the same rn ... I ’m tryna take a ‘ heal the world ’ selfie
A man this shit ai n’t no game .
A lot of us might not be coming back and I been here since November .. so y’ all tighten up and post sum positive or sum good lucky wishes or prayers .. everything y’ all post do n’t got to be funny .. 💯 ik y’ all clout chasing but damn show love too

If I responded angrily to every person who seeks to provoke anger from me on social media , I ’d never experience peace , purpose or progress .
Be a good steward of your energy .
It ’s okay to let provocateurs leave empty handed .
Still we rise 🙏 🏾
